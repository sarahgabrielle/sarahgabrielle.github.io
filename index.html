								<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
							</header>
              <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/photo.png" alt="" /></span>
                Hi, I’m Sarah and here is a little bit about me...<br />

                I’m into all things arts & culture, sports, cooking and travelling – they bring me a lot of joy, transport me to a new place, allow me to disconnect and live in the moment. I also find that it encourages me to cherish my intuition, creativity and to constantly search for new ideas. <br />

                Now for my story…<br />

                With a business degree and a five-year career in the insurance industry under my belt, my vision for the future should have been clear. But I always had this feeling that something was missing, a purpose that I didn’t feel I could achieve following the path I was on.  The real trigger came about when I watched a BBC programme called the Big Life Fix with Simon Reeve. That programme really touched and inspired me to pursue a career within tech in some shape or form and made me come to the realisation that I don’t want to just sit back and watch the tech wave change the world, I want to be part of the change. I had always been interested in tech and gaming from a young age but had never seriously considered it as a career, so I decided to try my hand at coding (via various online courses), to see whether I was capable of learning and grasping it. I then got absolutely hooked! That’s when I decided to dedicate my full time and attention to it, quitting my job in insurance and joining the WDI program at GA to further develop my coding skills. During this time, I have learnt the fundamentals of various core coding languages, built dynamic websites and games and created a portfolio that I’m proud to call my own.<br />

                I’m currently working on a side project with some fellow UX GA grads and for a bit of fun I enjoy doing coding challenges and going to meetups.
                I'm excited to continue developing my skills - pairing sound technical craft with user-friendly interaction in the hope of positively impacting the world around me and improving the lives of others.

								<h2>SKILØG<br /></h2>
								<p>A ski app which renders Google’s ski trail maps and provides a weekly weather forecast of your ski resort. Other features include instant messaging, the ability to upload holiday photos along with travel documents so you can view everything in one place. I chose this as I am really passionate about skiing & snowboarding and wanted to challenge myself. This is a MERN stack application and makes use of the Google Map and Dark Sky API. Technologies used: React, socket.io, Express.js, SCSS, Bootstrap, MongoDB with Mongoose models, JSX, Mocha, Chai, and Enzyme.</p>

                <h2>HAPPY CABBY<br /></h2>
								<p>This was a group project, whereby our instructors partnered us with other classmates to work as a team, implementing our new found knowledge of Angular to create a MEAN stack app. After brainstorming together we came up with Happy Cabby, an app to help taxi drivers make more money and spend less time on the road. It combines data from 3rd party APIs to help drivers find high demand areas (based on events going on around them) thus enabling them to save time, petrol and earn more. Technologies used: Express.js, AngularJS, Google Maps API, Eventful API, Gulp, SCSS, Bulma, MongoDB with Mongoose models, HTML5.</p>

                <h2>OBSCOUTURE<br /></h2>
								<p>The app was created as I love fashion and discovering independent designers so I wanted to build a platform for unknown clothing designers to showcase their brand online and connect with a global audience. Users can browse brands and “like” a specific brand, which is then saved to the user’s profile page. My inspiration for this app came from Instagram and LiketoKnow.it. Technologies used: Express.js with EJS views, Gulp, SCSS, MongoDB with Mongoose models, jQuery, HTML5, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap.</p>

                <h2>SPACE WARS<br /></h2>
								<p>A two-dimensional browser game in which the player controls a spaceship by moving it horizontally and vertically across the screen. The aim is to navigate through space by avoiding the oncoming planets, earning points for each planet successfully avoided. As more planets are avoided, the spaceship speeds up. Each level completed brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end. I drew inspiration from Space Invaders, a game I used to love playing when I was younger, hence the retro/arcade feel. The game is written in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.</p>
